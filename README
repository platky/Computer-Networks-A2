//============================

To run this program you must first compile the .java files using
make (seen below).

On 3 different machines you will do the following:

You then run the emulator (provided by school) by typing
->	./nEmulator-linux386 9991 host2 9994 9993 host3 9992 1 0.2 0
Feel free to change the ports but be consistent for all commands

Now we run the data receiver by typing
->	java receiver host1 9993 9994 <output File>

Finally run the data sender
-> 	java sender host1 9991 9992 <input file>

*It is very important to run the sytem in this order and on
seperate machines

//============================
